# Capstone-Project
This is the repository of our Capstone Project in Mobile Web Technology course in BUCT.
# Name
Daily NBA
# Equipment and language
we use the Javascript and use the "react native" to create our project.
# Purpose
NBA is the most popular basketball league in the world and there are a great number of people wanting to get the information at once.
So we want to develop a NBA app to make people who want to get these information more convenient.
# What we want to do
What we would like to do is to develop an app to view daily NBA news, 
you can also see different games' result and stats of players. 
If we have extra capability to develop other functions, 
maybe we will set up a community where different people can communicate with each other to discuss the games.

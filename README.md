# Capstone-Project
This is the repository of our Capstone Project in Mobile Web Technology course in BUCT.

What we would like to do is to develop an app to view daily NBA news, 
you can also see different games' result and stats of players. 
If we have extra capability to develop other functions, 
maybe we will set up a community where different people can communicate with each other to discuss the games.

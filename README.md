# Capstone-Project
This is the repository of our Capstone Project in Mobile Web Technology course in BUCT.

# Name
Daily NBA

# Equipment and language
We use the Javascript language and the "react-native" structure to create our project.

# Purpose
NBA is the most popular basketball league in the world and there are a great number of people wanting to get the information at once.
So we want to develop a NBA app to make people who want to get these information more convenient.

# What we want to do
What we would like to do is to develop an app to view daily NBA news, 
you can also see different games' result and stats of players. 
If we have extra capability to develop other functions, 
maybe we will set up a community where different people can communicate with each other to discuss the games.

# Code Organization
Our codes are well-organized into 3 distinctive folders, including assets, Codes and Containers.
The root file to render the user interface is App.js, which contains 4 different screens named Games, Rankings, News and Players. The 4 specific files of screens are put into the Containers folder. And in each screen, we also imported other stateful and stateless components which lies in the Codes folder. The Codes folder contains 4 sub-folders to accomodate the codes used in each screens.
